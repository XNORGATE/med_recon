### Final Diagnosis:
- Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with lymph node metastasis and pleural invasion

### Brief explanation:
The patient's lung specimen shows a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with a maximum diameter of 6.0 cm. The tumor has pleural and lymphatic invasion, as well as vascular invasion. The tumor has metastasized to several lymph nodes, including the subcarinal lymph node, level 3 lymph nodes, and additional level 3 lymph nodes. The tumor has also invaded the bronchial resection margin, indicating that it is a high-grade malignancy.
