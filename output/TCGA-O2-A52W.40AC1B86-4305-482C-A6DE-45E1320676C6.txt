0.3 cm fragment of tan tissue previously frozen as AFl and the frozen remnant
is entirely submitted in block Al.

‘Lev a 3 lymph node (BF1)", received fresh for frozen section is a 0.5 x

x 0.2 cm fragment of tan-pink tissue previously frozen aa BF1 and the

zen ramnant is entirely submitted in block 31. Also received is a 6.2 % 0.1
-i cm fragment of tan-gray cissue that ia submitced entirely in block 52.

CLINICAL HISTORY:
zung nodule (history of right lowey mags-per eurgeon).

GR0ss EXAMINATION:

A. “Level 11 (AFL)", received fresh for frozen section ig a 0.5 x 0.4 % 6,3 cm
aggregate of brown-tan tissue which has been antirely frozen as AFL. the
frozen section remnant of which ia submitred in block Al.

B. "Right, lower lobe lung and middle (SF1)", received fresh for frozen
section ig 3 480 gram, 20 x 17 x 8.2 cm lobectomy spacimen. The pleura
demonstrates a 4.5 x 4 ¢m area of puckering and white discoloration as well as
focal areas of hemorrhagic focal adhesiona. Serial sectioning demonstrates a
3 x 4.7 x 2.2 om well-circumscribed central necrotic maas directly abutring
the aforementioned area of pleural retraction and discoloration and 5.3 cm
from the brenchial margin. The remainder of the parenchymal cut aurface
demonstrates a moderata amount of emphysematous change, bur is otherwise
crepitant and brown-tan. The bronchial mucosa is trabeculated white-tan with
no abnormalities noted, A representative section of the bronchial margin has
been previously frozen as BF1, the frozen eection remnanc of which is

submitted in block B1. Additional representative sactions ara submitted as
follows:

BLOCK SUMMARY:

B2- vascular margins .

B3- lobar lymph node candidates

84-5 sections of masa with respect to pleura (A VVG stain is prospectively
requested in B4}

BG- mass with adjacent uninvolved

B7- central gection of mass

B8-5 sactiona of uninvolved parenchyma

C. “hevel 7", received in formalin is a 5 x 4 x 3 cm aggregate of brown-tan
soft tissue which is sectioned and submitted entirely in blocks C1-2.

DB. "42 lymph node", raceived in formalin is a € x 5 x & em aggregate of

yellow-tan soft tissue which ia serially sectioned and antirely submitted in
blocks Di-2.

E. "Level 8", received in formalin is a 0.9 x 0.4 % 0.2 am aggregate of
brewn-tan soft tissue which is submitted entirely in block El.

INTRA OPERATIVE CONSULTATION:
A. "Level Li":AFl-no tumor ia seen

B. "Right, lower and middle lobe lung”: aF1-bronchial margin iz negative for
