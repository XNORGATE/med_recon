Clinical Information

PRE-OP DIAGNOSIS: Lung cancer
POST-OP DIAGNOSIS: Same
TYPE OF PROCEDURE: Bronchoscopy, right VATS. Removal right lower lobe

Gross Description
Specimen is received in 6 parts:

A. The specimen is labeled "RIGHT LOWER LOBE" and is received unfixed. It consists of a lobe of the lung measuring 15 x 12 x 8
om and weighing 280 g. The pleural surface is pink-purple and smooth and shows multiple anthracotic markings. The bronchial and
vascular margins are stapled shut. The soft tissue margin of resection measuring 2 cm, 4cm, 4.5 cm and 5 cm.

A 1.3 x 1.2 x 1.2 cm an ill-defined gray-tan mass is identified 2 cm away from the bronchial margin of resection and 3 cm away from
the closest pleural surface. Pleural surface closest to the mass is covered with smooth surface without any papillary excrescences and
is inked. Remaining portion of the lung shows dark red tan congested parenchyma without other lesions. At the hilum 0.7 x 0. 7 x 0.5

em and 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm lymph nodes are identified. Representative sections are submitted as follows:

Al = bronchial and vascular margin of resection

A2 = soft tissue margin of resection

A3-AS5 = mass, entirely submitted

A 6 = random section of the lung

A7 = 2 lymph nodes

A8 = closest pleural surface to the mass.

B. The specimen is labeled "LEVEL VII" and is received in formalin. It consists of 3 black tan lymph nodes ranging from 0.5x 0.5 x
0.3 - 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. Entirely submitted in cassette B1.

C. The specimen is labeled "LEVEL X" and is received in formalin. It consists of 4 black tan lymph nodes measuring 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.2-
0.8 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. Entirely submitted in cassette C1

D. The specimen is labeled "RIGHT MIDDLE LOBE" and is received in formalin. It consists of a wedge shaped piece of lung tissue
measuring 3.5 x 1 x 0.7 cm which 3.5 cm stapled margin of resection. In the center portion 1 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm irregular fragmented area
is noted which is 0.3 cm away from the stapled margin of resection which is inked red. Entirely submitted in cassettes D1-D2.

E. The specimen is labeled "R4" and is received in formalin. It consists of a single black lymph node measuring 2 x 0.7 x 0.6. cm.
Sectioned and entirely submitted in cassette El.

F, The specimen is labeled "R2" and is received in formalin. It consists of a single black tan lymph node measuring 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.5
