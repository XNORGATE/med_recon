Gross Anatomic Description

Specimens received in five containers.

Specimen A: Designated “tight colon distal ileum* is received in formalin labeled with the patient's
name and “right colon distal ileum“. Specimen consists of a portion of ileum with attached right colon
which measures a total of 35.3 cm in length. The smail intestine measures 17.2 cm in length x 3.5 cm
in cross sectional diameter. The colon measures 18.1 cm in length and the cross sectional diameter
ranges from 5.6 cm distally to 10.2 cm Surrounding an enlarged area with focal puckering of the
serosal surface. Attached to the colon is a portion of muscle and connective tissue located posteriorly
which measures 12.5 x 6.3 x 5.1 cm. The remainder of the serosal surface of both the ileum and right
colon are smooth, tan/pink and unremarkable. Attached pericolic fibroadipose tissue |s present. This
area of puckering measures 9.5 cm from the colonic resection margin. The area composed of the
muscle and connective tissue is inked green. The ileal wail measures 0.2 cm in thickness and the
mucosal surface of the ileum with grossly unremarkable. Grossly adjacent to the ileal cecal valve is a
large variegated polypoid exophytic pink to green colored bosselated mass measuring 9.5 x 8.0 cm
and extends to a depth of 8.5 cm. Focally the mass extends to the inked green muscle connective
tissue resection margin. The remainder of the colonic mucosa is grossly unremarkable and free of
additional polyps or diverticuli. The average wall thickness of the colon measures 0.2 cm to 0.3 cm.
Gross photographs are taken. Multiple lymph nodes are identified ranging from 0.2 cm up to 3.1 cm in
greatest dimension. The appendix is identified upon cross sectioning of the muscle and soft tissue.
The appendix is totally encased within the soft tissue making a measurement of length not possible.
The cross-sectional diameter averages 0.6 cm with an intact lumen that is 0.2 cm. The tumor does
appear grossly to involve the appendix.

Gross photographs are taken.

Section code: Ai — colon resection margin; A2 ~ ileal resection margin; A3 — additional representative
section of unremarkable colon and ileum; A4-A7 — representative sections tumor; A8-A10 ~ sections
of tumor with deepest muscle and soft issue invasion extending to the inked margin; A11 = three

Specimen B; Designated “inferior margin" is received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
"inferior margin". Specimen consists of two fragments of soft tan/yellow friable fibroadipose
connective tissue measuring 4.4 x 3.5 x 2.0 cm and 3.5 x 3.8 x 1.8 cm. Each specimen is entirely
inked blue. Cut surface of each piece reveals white firm fibrous tissue admixed with tan/yellow
fibroadipose tissue. Representative sections of the heavily fibrous areas are submitted in casettes
B1-B8.

Section code: B1-B8 — entire specimen.

Specimen C; Designated "posterior margin” is received in formalin labeled with the patient’s name
and "posterior margin*. Specimen consists of two smal fragments of soft tan/yellow bosselated
fibroadipose connective tissue each measuring 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm. The specimens are both entirely
inked blue and bisected and submitted in one cassette.

Section code: C1 - entire specimen.

Specimen D: Designated “lateral margin’ is received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
“lateral margin“. Specimen consists of a single portion of soft tan/yellow bosselated fibroadipose
connective tissue measuring 2.1 x 2.0x 1.0 cm. The specimen is entirely Inked blue. Cut surface
reveals predominantly yellow tan bosselated fibroadipose tissue with focal white fibrous streaks.
Section code: D1 — entire specimen bisected.

Specimen E: Designated “superior margin® is received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and
“superior margin’. Specimen consists of two smail fragments of soft tan/yellow bosselated
fibroadipose connective tissue measuring 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm and 2.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm. Each specimen is
both entirely inked blue and bisected. Cut surface reveals predominantly yellow tan bosselated
fibroadipose tissue with focal white fibrous streaks.

Section code: E1-E2 - one specimen each, bisected, entire specimen.
